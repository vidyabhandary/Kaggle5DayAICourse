## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Understood **what AI Agents really are** — systems that *reason, act, observe, and iterate* instead of just generating text.  
- Learned the **Agent Architecture**:  
  - **Model (Brain)** for reasoning  
  - **Tools (Hands)** for taking real-world actions  
  - **Orchestration Layer (Nervous System)** for planning, memory, and control  
- Built my first agent using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** + **ADK**, including planning, tool-calling, and multi-step reasoning loops.  
- Created a **multi-agent system** and understood coordination patterns like:  
  - Shared vs. individual session histories  
  - Delegation between agents  
  - A2A communication  
- Learned the foundations of **Context Engineering**:  
  - Sessions vs. Memory  
  - How to build dynamic context windows  
  - How agents maintain state, recall past interactions, and optimize long conversations  
- Studied **Agent Quality**:  
  - Observability (logs, traces, metrics)  
  - LLM-as-a-Judge & evaluation datasets  
  - Safety, robustness, and guardrails  
- Understood **productionizing agents**:  
  - CI/CD pipelines for agents  
  - Safe rollout strategies  
  - Monitoring cost, latency, and drift  
  - Security hardening, identity, and constrained policies  
- Explored **interoperability** through **MCP** and **A2A**, enabling tools, remote agents, and enterprise integration  
- Gained hands-on experience using **Google Search grounding**, **built-in tools**, and **NotebookLM** for research and refinement
