Here are some of the key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:** AI algorithms are analyzing vast genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic datasets to identify previously unknown biological targets implicated in diseases. This goes beyond well-understood pathways to uncover more intricate disease drivers.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are becoming better at predicting whether a newly identified target can be effectively modulated by a drug molecule, saving time and resources by focusing on more promising avenues.\n*   **Multi-omics Integration:** Advanced AI techniques are integrating data from various \"omics\" (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.) to provide a more holistic understanding of disease biology and identify more robust drug targets.\n\n**2. Accelerating Small Molecule and Biologics Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Drug Design:** Generative AI models (like GANs and VAEs) are being used to design entirely new molecular structures with desired properties from scratch, rather than just screening existing libraries. This allows for the creation of novel chemical entities with improved efficacy and safety profiles.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** AI helps in optimizing the potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion - ADME), and toxicity of lead drug candidates.\n*   **Antibody Design and Engineering:** For biologics, AI is aiding in designing antibodies with specific binding affinities, reduced immunogenicity, and improved therapeutic efficacy.\n\n**3. Improving Preclinical and Clinical Trial Efficiency:**\n\n*   **Predicting ADMET Properties:** AI models are getting increasingly accurate at predicting a drug candidate's absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) early in the discovery process, reducing the number of costly failures in later stages.\n*   **Virtual Screening:** AI can rapidly screen massive virtual libraries of compounds against a target, identifying potential hits much faster than traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery for Patient Stratification:** AI is crucial in identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to a particular drug, enabling more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Synthetic Control Arms:** AI is being explored to create \"synthetic\" control arms for clinical trials using real-world data, potentially reducing the need for placebo groups in certain situations.\n\n**4. Novel Modalities and Therapeutic Approaches:**\n\n*   **Peptide Therapeutics:** AI is assisting in the design and optimization of peptide-based drugs, which offer unique therapeutic potential.\n*   **RNA Therapeutics:** AI is being applied to design and optimize RNA-based therapies (like mRNA and siRNA), which are revolutionizing vaccine development and gene therapy.\n*   **PROTACs and Molecular Glues:** These novel therapeutic modalities that hijack cellular machinery to degrade disease-causing proteins are benefiting from AI's ability to design complex molecular interactions.\n\n**Examples of recent trends and companies making strides:**\n\n*   **Focus on Rare Diseases:** AI is enabling the discovery of drugs for rare diseases that might have been historically overlooked due to smaller patient populations.\n*   **Data-Driven Drug Repurposing:** AI is excelling at identifying new uses for existing drugs, a faster and less risky path to market.\n*   **The Rise of AI-Native Biotech Companies:** A new wave of biotech companies are being founded with AI at their core, aiming to fundamentally change the drug discovery paradigm. Examples include **Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Atomwise, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, and BenevolentAI**, among many others.\n*   **Big Pharma Collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies are increasingly partnering with AI drug discovery firms or building their own in-house AI capabilities.\n\n**Challenges remain, including:**\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** The effectiveness of AI heavily relies on high-quality, diverse, and well-annotated biological data.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still require rigorous experimental validation, which can be a bottleneck.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** Evolving regulatory frameworks for AI-discovered drugs.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** Understanding the precise mechanisms by which some AI models arrive at their conclusions can be challenging.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just a tool in drug discovery; it's becoming a fundamental engine, driving innovation, accelerating timelines, and opening up new possibilities for treating diseases that were previously intractable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned in my previous response regarding drug discovery: **Accelerating Small Molecule and Biologics Design.**\n\nThis is a really crucial area where AI is making a massive impact. Let's break it down further:\n\n**1. De Novo Drug Design:**\n\n*   **What it means:** Instead of sifting through vast existing libraries of chemical compounds to find one that *might* work, de novo design uses AI to *create* entirely new molecular structures that are predicted to have specific desired properties. It's like an architect designing a building from scratch rather than just picking from a catalog of existing blueprints.\n*   **How AI does it:**\n    *   **Generative Models:** AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are trained on massive datasets of known molecules and their properties. They learn the underlying \"rules\" of chemistry and molecular design.\n    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** These models can then be guided by specific \"goals\" or \"rewards,\" such as a high binding affinity to a disease target, good solubility, or low predicted toxicity. The AI iteratively generates molecules, gets feedback on their predicted properties, and refines its designs.\n*   **Why it's revolutionary:**\n    *   **Novelty:** It allows for the discovery of completely new chemical scaffolds that wouldn't have been found through traditional screening.\n    *   **Efficiency:** It can dramatically speed up the process of identifying promising starting points for drug development.\n    *   **Optimization:** AI can be instructed to design molecules with a specific balance of properties, rather than having to compromise.\n\n**2. Optimizing Lead Compounds:**\n\n*   **What it means:** Once an initial \"hit\" or \"lead\" compound is identified (whether through traditional methods or de novo design), it's rarely perfect. It might bind to the target but not strongly enough, or it might have undesirable side effects. AI helps refine these lead compounds.\n*   **How AI does it:**\n    *   **Predictive Modeling:** AI models can predict a wide range of properties for slightly modified versions of a lead compound. This includes:\n        *   **Potency:** How strongly it binds to the target.\n        *   **Selectivity:** How well it binds to the intended target versus off-targets (which can cause side effects).\n        *   **ADME Properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion):** How the drug behaves in the body – can it be absorbed? Does it reach the target tissue? How is it broken down and eliminated?\n        *   **Toxicity:** Predicting potential harmful effects.\n    *   **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Prediction:** AI can analyze how small changes in a molecule's structure affect its biological activity, guiding chemists on where to make modifications.\n*   **Why it's important:**\n    *   **Reduced Attrition:** By optimizing early, AI helps reduce the number of drug candidates that fail in later, more expensive stages of development due to poor efficacy or safety.\n    *   **Faster Development Cycles:** Iterative optimization with AI is much faster than traditional trial-and-error laboratory experiments.\n\n**3. Designing and Engineering Biologics (like Antibodies):**\n\n*   **What it means:** Biologics are large, complex molecules like antibodies, proteins, and nucleic acids. Designing them requires a different set of AI tools.\n*   **How AI does it:**\n    *   **Antibody Design:** AI can predict how changes in an antibody's amino acid sequence will affect its binding to a target, its stability, and its immunogenicity (the likelihood of triggering an immune response). It can also help design antibodies that can bind to multiple targets or have enhanced effector functions.\n    *   **Protein Engineering:** AI is used to design novel proteins with specific functions or to improve the properties of existing proteins for therapeutic use.\n    *   **Nucleic Acid Therapeutics (e.g., mRNA, siRNA):** AI is crucial for designing the sequences of these molecules to ensure stability, efficient delivery, and desired therapeutic effects, while minimizing off-target interactions.\n*   **Why it's significant:**\n    *   **Targeted Therapies:** Biologics are often highly specific and can target diseases in ways that small molecules cannot. AI is making their design more precise and efficient.\n    *   **New Therapeutic Modalities:** AI is enabling the development of entirely new classes of biologics.\n\n**In essence, AI is transforming the design phase of drug discovery from a process of educated guesswork and extensive experimentation into a more predictive, iterative, and rational engineering discipline.** This leads to the development of more effective, safer, and potentially more affordable medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven drug discovery, particularly in the area of accelerating small molecule and biologics design, is dynamic and includes a mix of established pharmaceutical giants and specialized AI biotech startups.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main players and categories:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
